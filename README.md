# Triangles intersection in 3D-space

## How to use
There are makefile. To compile program use **make** or **make triangles**. There are also tests for Vector3D (**make vector_tests**) and Triangle3D+Intersection3D (**make triangle_test**). triangles program input format: number_of_triangles triang1_points triang2_points ..., triang[i]_points is p0.x p0.y p0.z p1.x p1.y p1.z p2.x p2.y p2.z
